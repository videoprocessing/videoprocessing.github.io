  features:
    - "We consider different color corrections of compressed videos which increase the values of full-reference metric VMAF and almost donâ€™t decrease other widely-used metric SSIM"
    - "The proposed video approach shows the metric in-applicability in some cases for video codecs comparisons, as it may be used for cheating in the comparisons via tuning to improve this metric values."
