# About Us

The Graphics & Media Lab Video Group is part of the Computer Science Department of Lomonosov Moscow State University. The Graphics Group began at the end of the 1980s, and the Graphics & Media Lab was officially founded in 1998. The main research avenues of the lab include areas of computer graphics, computer vision and media processing (audio, image, and video). A number of patents have been acquired based on the labâ€™s research, and other results have been presented in various publications. The main research avenues of the Graphics & Media Lab Video Group are video processing, video quality analysis, and video compression (codecs testing and tuning, quality metrics research, and codecs development).

<!-- ### #1 video codecs analysis
The companies send us the codecs, and we find out, which one is better.

Some of our [reports](/codecs/) are publically available.

### #1 video quality estimation tool
We have [VQMT](/vqmt/) for monoscopic and [VQMT3D](/stereo_quality/) for stereoscopic video. We can predict in advance whether you will have a headache after watching the 3D movie. The tools have more quality assessment metrics than any concurrent ones declared. Take a look at our assessment reports on the projects' pages. Our stats by 2019:


### #1 video matting benchmark
The [VideoMatting](https://videomatting.com/) project is the first public objective benchmark for video-matting methods. Our work ranks existing methods and aids developers of new methods in improving their results. Previous cases of estimation:

### #1 subjective quality estimation
The [Subjectify](http://subjectify.us) project provides a crowd-sourced algorithms evaluation platform. It is designed for the subjective comparison of images, video, and sound processing methods.  -->
