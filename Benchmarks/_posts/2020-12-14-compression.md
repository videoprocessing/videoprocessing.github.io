### About competition
This competition focuses on the advantages of algorithms and their implementations for universal lossless data compression rather than for certain data types. We test compressors under the following scenarios:
* Test 1: Qualitative-data compression. 
  * This year we use text data.
* Test 2: Quantitative-data compression
  * The test set for this year contains images, most of which are photographic.
* Test 3: Mixed-data compression
  * This year's focus is on slightly preprocessed executable files (we removed incompressible chunks).
* Test 4: Small-block-data compression
  * We use small blocks of textual and mixed data to evaluate how compressors behave when the data size is severely limited, such as in block-storage systems.
