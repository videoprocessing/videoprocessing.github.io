## Key features of the Benchmark Suite

*   **The most diverse dataset** for alignment of near-duplicate videos:
    *   **560 test pairs in each Benchmark** with a total duration of ~2 million frames
    *   Combinations of **13 frequent distortions** obtained due to human/machine video editing and processing
*   **Test your method on our Benchmarks:**
    * **Local time distortions:** occur due to video processing (transmitting, compressing with low bitrate etc.)
    * **Global time distortions:** occur due to video editing
    * **Mixed version** for versatility testing on both distortion types
* **Find the best method** for your near-duplicate video alignment requirements:
    * Each Benchmark contains three distortion presets representing use cases with different complexity

We appreciate new ideas. Please, write us an e-mail to <aligners-benchmark@videoprocessing.ai>
