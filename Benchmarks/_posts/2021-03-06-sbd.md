### Comprehensive analysis of shot boundary detection methods


This benchmark designed to evaluate different algorithms of the Shot Boundary Detection task.
The benchmark provides an opportunity to test your own algorithm for detection of cuts, dissolves, wipes and fades scene transition.

### Key features of the Benchmark


*   **Extensive and diverse datasets** for shot-boundary detection testing:
    *   *120+ videos* from 2 datasets: RAI, MSU CC
    *   *1000+ minutes* with 1700+ shot transitions
    *   Cut, dissolve and fade transitions, complex scenes with high spatial and temporal complexity
*   **Beautiful and easy-interpreting visualizations** of most common quality metrics for each category of scene transitions:
    * F1 score, Precision and Recall
    * Speed performance depending on the resolution of the input video stream 


To participate in our benchmark, please follow instructions in the [How to submit](#how-to-submit) section.

We appreciate new ideas. Please, write us an e-mail to <sbd-benchmark@videoprocessing.ai>

### Definitions

* Shot — the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts
	* Cut Transitions — a sudden abrupt transition from one shot to another
		* In this case we mark the first frame of a new shot as shot with cut transition


* Gradual Transitions — two shots are combined using chromatic, spatial or spatial-chromatic effects which gradually replace one shot by another
	* In this case we mark a continuous series of frames as a gradual transition. Algorithms must detect exactly one frame as a gradual transition from this series

* Fade-out and fade-in Transitions are used to describe a transition to and from a blank image


### <span id="citation"></span> How to submit

Send us an email to <sbd-benchmark@videoprocessing.ai> with the following:

* File with .exe extension with your algorithm and instructions to run it from console. When launched from console we expect your file to have following options:
  * -i - path to input video
  * -o - path to output of your algorithm
  * -t - threshold, if it required in your algorithm
* If you give us permission to publish results of your algorithm.
