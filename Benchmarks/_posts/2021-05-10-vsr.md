## Discover the newest methods and find the most appropriate method for your tasks

## Key features of the Benchmark


*   **New metrics for detail restoration quality**
    *   Check Video Super Resolution models’ ability to restore real details 
*   **The most complex content for restoration task**: faces, text, QR-codes, car numbers, unpatterned textures, small details
    *   See plots and visualizations for particular content types
*   **Different degradation types to lower the resolution**: bicubic and gauss, with and without noise 
    *   Many methods use only one degradation type for their training datasets (e.g. bucubic interpolation) and do not work well on others. **Choose method that didn’t overfit to the test dataset**
*   Subjective comparison of new and popular Super-Resolution methods

**Full leaderboard you can see [here](https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/video-super-resolution.html).**


## Charts
In these section you can see barcharts and speed-to-performance plots. You can choose metric, motion, content and degradation type, see tests with or without noise.

## <span id="participate"></span> Your method submission
**Verify restoration ability of your VSR algorithm and compare it with state-of-the-art solutions.**


1. Download input
* Download input low-resolution videos as a sequences of frames in .png format


2. Apply your algorithm
* Restore high-resolution frames with your algorithm

3. Send us result to  <vsr-benchmark@videoprocessing.ai>
