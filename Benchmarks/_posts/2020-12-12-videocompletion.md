### Introduction
The Video Completion project introduces the first benchmark for video-completion methods. We present results for different methods on a range of diverse test sequences which are available for viewing on a player equipped with a movable zoom region. Additionally, we provide the results of an objective analysis using quality metrics that were carefully selected in our study on video-completion perceptual quality. We believe that our work can help rank existing methods and assist developers of new general-purpose video-completion methods.

### Participate
We invite developers of video-completion methods to use our benchmark. We can evaluate the submitted data and report quality scores to the developer. In cases where the developer specifically grants permission, we will publish the results on our site. The test sequences with the respective completion masks are available [here](https://videocompletion.org/#participate)


**If you would like to participate read the full submission rules [here](https://videocompletion.org/#participate).**
