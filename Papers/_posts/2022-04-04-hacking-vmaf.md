title: "Hacking VMAF with Video Color and Contrast Distortion"
external_url: "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334388692_Hacking_VMAF_with_Video_Color_and_Contrast_Distortion"
features:
  - "We consider different color corrections of compressed videos which increase the values of full-reference metric VMAF and almost donâ€™t decrease other widely-used metric SSIM"
  - "The proposed video approach shows the metric in-applicability in some cases for video codecs comparisons, as it may be used for cheating in the comparisons via tuning to improve this metric values."
